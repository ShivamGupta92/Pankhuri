## 🌸 Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, women face unique health challenges. While technology has been a beacon in various domains, women's health often remains in the shadows. Pankhuri emerges as a beacon, shedding light on these areas with the brilliance of AI. We believe that every woman deserves personalized insights, empowering education, and a supportive community.

Women's health is a tapestry of complexity. Many platforms touch upon it but fail to encapsulate its depth and breadth. We identified gaps:
